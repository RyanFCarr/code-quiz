Countdown.js is a simple script to add a countdown timer
for your website. Currently it can only do full minutes
and partial minutes aren't supported. This script is a fork of http://jsfiddle.net/HRrYG/ with some added extensions. Since the original code that I forked was released under Creative Commons by SA license, I have to release this code under the same license. You can view a live demo of this code at http://jsfiddle.net/JmrQE/2/.
